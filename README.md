# 🙋‍♀️ Hi, I’m Natalia!

A passionate Frontend Developer from Moscow.

I'm currently deepening my knowlege in Angular, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS, while exploring modern tools to excel as a frontend developer.

With over 10 years of experience in **sports event management**, I have honed my skills in teamwork, time management, and leadership by successfully managing complex projects and collaborating with diverse teams. Transitioning into frontend development, I am eager to leverage this experience to craft intuitive and user-friendly web applications that solve real-world problems.
